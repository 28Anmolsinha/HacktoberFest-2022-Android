## Notes App
### Problem Statement
Notes application stores the various notes of different subjects. This will help the students to get their notes at ease. Students will be the main user of this app so the content & quality of the notes should be maintained and the UI should be designed accordingly.

To build this application you would need to make use of Android Studio as a platform for app development. Also, you need to write the code using Kotlin or Java. And for the interactive user interface, you can use XML.

### Input
User can choose the subject with the help of buttons or cardviews.

### Output
User will be shown notes of his/her desired subject.

#### Contributing
If your app has notes of good quality and content and useful for students and also compact in size, your solution will be merged with the main branch. If you have any questions, feel free to open an issue.
