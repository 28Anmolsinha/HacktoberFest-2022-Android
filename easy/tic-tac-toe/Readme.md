## Tic Tac Toe

Tic Tac Toe is a game in which two players take turns in drawing either an 'O' or an 'X' in one square of a grid consisting of nine squares.The person who succeeds in placing three of their marks in horizontal, vertical or diagonal row is the winner. If the match is drawn i.e. none of the player is able to place their in the straight line then a toast should be shown and new match should start.

To build this application you would need to make use of Android Studio as a platform for app development. Also, you need to write the code using Kotlin. And for the interactive user interface, you can use XML.

### Input
Two players choose their mark i.e. either O or X and place their mark in the grid respectively.

### Output
Player who succeeds in placing three consecutive mark in a straight line won the game.

#### Contributing
If your app performs all the cases like win, lost or draw and compact in size, your solution will be merged with the main branch. If you have any questions, feel free to open an issue.
