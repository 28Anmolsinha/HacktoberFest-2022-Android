## Paint App

Paint app provides the interface to the users to doodle 
anything they want. Different shapes and many other elements 
can also be included. Mainly children will use this app so the app 
should be designed in attractive and interactive manner.

To build this application you would need to make use of Android
 Studio as a platform for app development. Also, you need to 
 write the code using Kotlin or Java. And for the interactive 
 user interface, you can use XML.

### Input
Users can give input like images, shapes, colors and many more.

### Output
The final painting that will be saved by the user will be output.

#### Contributing
If your app is able to display all the elements and is
 interactive and also compact in size, your solution will be
merged with the main branch. If you have any questions, feel 
free to open an issue.
