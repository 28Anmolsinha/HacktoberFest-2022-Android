## Contact App
### Problem Statement
It is basically a contact manager app that will manage your contacts.User can not only see the list of contacts but also can create a new contact or delete a contact that already exists in the list. Users are free to show their creativity in making this app interactive.

To build this application you would need to make use of Android Studio as a platform for app development. Also, you need to write the code using Kotlin or Java. And for the interactive user interface, you can use XML.

### Input
User can add or delete any contact in the list.

### Output
All the updations should be shown to user. For example, if user deletes any contact then it will be reflected in the list.

#### Contributing
If your app is able to display the contacts and add or delete the contacts and also compact in size, your solution will be merged with the main branch. If you have any questions, feel free to open an issue.
