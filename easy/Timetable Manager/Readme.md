## TimeTable Manager
### Problem Statement

TimeTable Manager app helps the users to manage their time and 
to do their tasks accordingly. Users can be students, teacher or 
any other employee that need to keep the track of their time. 
This app allows the user to add a new timetable or to delete 
the existing one.


To build this application you would need to make use of Android
 Studio as a platform for app development. Also, you need to 
 write the code using Kotlin or Java. And for the interactive 
 user interface, you can use XML.

### Input
Users can add or delete the TimeTable.

### Output
The changes done by user should be reflected in the app. 

#### Contributing
If your app is able to add or delete the sounds and also compact in size, your solution will be
merged with the main branch. If you have any questions, feel 
free to open an issue.
