## Sound Recorder
### Problem Statement

Sound Recorder app is an app that records the voice or sound 
and stores it in the phone. It will take system permission 
to use mic.


To build this application you would need to make use of Android
 Studio as a platform for app development. Also, you need to 
 write the code using Kotlin or Java. And for the interactive 
 user interface, you can use XML.

### Input
Users can add or delete the voice message.

### Output
The changes done by user should be reflected in the app. 
The user is able to hear the voice or sound recorded.

#### Contributing
If your app is able to add or delete the sounds and also compact in size, your solution will be
merged with the main branch. If you have any questions, feel 
free to open an issue.
