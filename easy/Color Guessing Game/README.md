## Color Guessing Game In Android

### Problem Statement:
This is a simple project aimed at teaching kids the colors in an interactive manner. It will show colors in the form of shapes and drawings to make it interactive learning.First, it will show the colors and their names. After that, it will ask kids what color is shown. If they answer correctly, it will play sounds of claps making kids happy. To build this application you would need to make use of Android Studio as a platform for app development. Also, you need to write the code using Kotlin. And for the interactive user interface, you can use XML.

The users would be mainly the kids; thus this application will be built as simple and interactive as it can. There would be a no. of options provided to them from which they will choose one.
### Input
Input should be given by children via entering correct and incorrect answers of the color showing in shapes.
### Output
If the user gives correct answer then you play clapping sound and if not then you play some error sound and present next question.
### Contribution
If your application performs the desired with efficient manner, then your solution will be merged with the main branch. If you have any question, feel free to open an issue.
