## News Application

Contributors are required to build an app for news update along with the notification feature and other features which should be customized and made on personal preferences. Show your creativity and put your best forward! :D

### Input
Perform the features necessary for the news application like the ones which are published, but make sure not to make a clone, just use your creativity and put the original app forward!

### Output
The app should be able to notify the news to the user- both national, international and for sports column too.

### Contributing
If your app works fine as per the features you mention with customization, your solution will be merged with the main branch. If you have any questions, feel free to open an issue.
