## Social Media Clone
### Problem Statement

Contributors are required to build a social media app clone. Now you can build the clone of your choice. All the features of the app should be customized and made on personal preferences. Show your creativity and put your best forward! :D

To build this application you would need to make use of Android Studio as a platform for app development. Also, you need to write the code using Kotlin or Java. And for the interactive user interface, you can use XML.

### Input
Perform the features starting from basic chatting option to mentioning in posts and other options with customization.

### Output
The app should be able to perform features that are common to te social media applications.

### Contributing
If your app works fine as per the features you mention with customization, your solution will be merged with the main branch. If you have any questions, feel free to open an issue.

#### Note : 
Put up screenshots of the working app in the comments too.
