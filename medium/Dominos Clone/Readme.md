## Dominos App (Clone)
### Problem Statement

You have to create a dominos clone that performs basic operations of taking orders from the Menu. You can even customize the app according to your preferences. It's all upto you. You can show your creativity at making the best app.

To build this application you would need to make use of Android Studio as a platform for app development. Also, you need to write the code using Kotlin or Java. And for the interactive user interface, you can use XML.

### Input
Perform basic ordering and tracking of orders like the dominos app along with atleast one customized feature.

### Output
The app should be able to run properly and place orders along with tracking.

### Contributing
If your app works fine as the original one with customization, your solution will be merged with the main branch. If you have any questions, feel free to open an issue.

#### Note : 
Put up screenshots of the working app in the comments too.
